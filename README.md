MongoDB assessment (3h total work)

Dependencies needed: 
  npm init (for the the node modules)
  npm install -y 
For testing: 
  npm --save-dev jest
To start it:
  nodemongoDB.js
 To start the tests:
  npm test

What I achieved to do: 
The code is implemented using JavaScript. I am new to testing in JavaScript so the reason I chose to work with it is because I have worked before with json objects only in JavaScript. 
The tests (mtest.js file) don't work because VScode did not find the test file for some rason. I tried to make them work but due to lack of time I had to leave it. Although I have included the test file alongside the file with the function that transforms the JSON object (mongoDB.js).I have manualy tried different objects to see the output and it works.
